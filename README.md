
Hi everyone ✋!

welcome to my first Website project.
The project is a simple resume website and is built on top of Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and Java Script.

💻 The site is divided into several sections:
* The main Section
* The projects Section
* The About Me Section

In the projects section you can go deeper into each project and enter its code via a github link,
And also in the About Me section there is a summary and a link to the social networks and ways to contact.

And anyway, thank you for being here, I appreciate it 🙏.
